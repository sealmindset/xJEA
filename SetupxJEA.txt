## Install WMF
# Check if running WMF >= 5.0
# 1. Open PowerShell as administrator, then check the current version

$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

# If WMF < 5.0 Then
# Download the WMF package from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/setup/install-configure
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator, then navigate to the folder containing the MSU file
# 2. Double-click the MSU to run it

## Check if WinRM is started
Test-WsMan

## If not started
Enable-PSRemoting –Force

# Set start mode to automatic
Set-Service WinRM -StartMode Automatic

# Verify start mode and state - it should be running
Get-WmiObject -Class win32_service | Where-Object {$_.name -like "WinRM"}

## Check if xJea is installed
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
# 2. Check if cmdlets is available
Get-Command *Module

# 3. Verify xJEA
Find-Module –Name ‘xJEA’ -Verbose

# 4. Install xJEA
Install-Module –Name ‘xJEA’

# 5. Verify that the ‘xJEA’ folder is there
ls -LiteralPath C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

# 6. SetupJEA
cd C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\xJea\0.2.16.6\Examples

# 7. Run
.\SetupJEA.ps1

# 8. Verify by Running the script 
.\Demo1.ps1

# 9. Verify 
Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Demo1EP

# 10. Next run Enter-PSSession –ComputerName localhost –ConfigurationName demo1ep.  You should see your prompt change 
# to [localhost]: PS] indicating you are now in the special constrained session configuration, (or JEA endpoint for short).  
# Run Get-Command.  Observe the limited set of commands available.

# 11. Validate that you cannot run other typical Windows PowerShell commands.  As an example, try to run Get-Content. 

# 12. To exit the JEA endpoint, run Exit.  You return to your previous Windows PowerShell session.
